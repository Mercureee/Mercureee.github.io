                      <!-- Description of Rust  -->
                      <p class="game-description"> Rust is a survival game set on an island. There are multiple servers for rust similar to minecraft. Every first thursday of each month they update the game and initiate a force wipe. A force wipe means that all the servers have to reset all their data and start new. The forces players that have obtained very powerful items to reset as well which helps keep it fair for everyone. There isn't a main goal in rust but you can join together with friends or go solo and explore. There are various locations around the map that can help you get more items as you progress. Rust is currently my top game I would say since it's incredibly fun to play with a group of friends or solo. The game is one of the most difficult games I have ever played and that is due to the fact that its quite difficult to pick up on. Players in rust aren't generally friendly towards newer players so it was difficult for me to start out. Once you start to get a rythm and understand the game better it becomes a lot of fun. The game is full of ups and downs where one moment you can win a lot and then before you can secure it you lose it all. One mechanic that I'm really enjoying about the game right now is the electricity portion of it. I just recently discovered new items I thought were useless but the wiring and gadgets you can set up is a whole lot of fun to do. </p>
