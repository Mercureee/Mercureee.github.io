          <p class="indie-description"> Stardew valley is the first game I think of when thinking of indie games. Stardew valley is one of the most laid back games I've played because the game doesn't direct you anywhere. You are free to do whatever you want and progress at however pace you want. My favorite thing to do in stardew is fishing. </p>
          <p class="indie-description"> Everhood has been one of the best rythm games I've ever played. The story and setting captures the feel of the different songs perfectly and the gameplay is engaging as well. I loved the different type of characters you encountered as well as the music that each person played. Every song felt unique and was difficult enough to be a challenge but not exactly easy.  </p>
          <p class="indie-description"> Moonlighter is one of my favorite rougelikes of all time. Each run through the dungeon feels unique and the gameplay feels smooth. I really enjoyed the fact that you could sell all the monster drops and it made you priotize finding certain monsters while also encouraging you to explore more rooms. The different upgrades would be able to help you progress naturally even if you were struggling.</p>
